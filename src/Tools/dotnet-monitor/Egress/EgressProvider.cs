     * == Egress Provider Design ==
     * - Each type of egress is implemented as an EgressProvider<TOptions>. The following are the built-in providers:
     *   - FileSystemEgressProvider: Allows egressing stream data to the file system.
     *   The egress provider options are typically use for describing to where stream data is to be egressed.
     * - When invoking an egress provider, the following are required:
     *   - an options instance describing to where the artifact should be egressed
     *   - an action for acquiring the stream data.
     *   - a settings instance describing aspects of the artifact, such as its file name and content type.
     *   The acquisition action can either provide the stream or allow the provider to provision the
     *   stream, which is passed into the action.
     * - When an egress provider finishes egressing stream data, it will return a value that identifies the location
     *   of where the stream data was egressed.
