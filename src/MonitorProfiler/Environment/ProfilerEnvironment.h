/// Abstraction for getting and setting environment variables from an ICorProfilerInfo instance.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// On non-Windows platforms, the runtime will cache the initial environment variable block. Managed
/// called to Environment::[Get|Set]EnvironmentVariable will only mutate the cache, not the real
/// environment block. Additionally, diagnostic commands for accessing the environment variables
/// only mutate and get from the cache, not the real environment block.
/// 
/// This cache is accessible by profilers via the ICorProfilerInfo11 methods instead of using the
/// native platform environment variable methods.
/// 
/// This class provides an abstraction over the profiler methods to allow getting access to the current
/// environment variables as seen by managed code and by diagnostic services.
