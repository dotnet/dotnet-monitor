# Storage Configuration

Some diagnostic features (e.g. memory dumps, stack traces) require that a directory is shared between the `dotnet monitor` tool and the target applications. The `Storage` configuration section allows specifying these directories to facilitate this sharing.

## Default Shared Path

First Available: 7.0

The default shared path option (`DefaultSharedPath`) can be set, which allows artifacts to be shared automatically without requiring additional configuration for each artifact type. By setting this property with an appropriate value, the following become available:
- dumps are temporarily stored in this directory or in a subdirectory.
- (8.0+) shared libraries are shared from `dotnet monitor` to target applications in this directory or in a subdirectory.
- (8.0+) in-process diagnostics share files back to `dotnet monitor` in this directory or in a subdirectory.

## Dumps Path

Unlike the other diagnostic artifacts (for example, traces), memory dumps aren't streamed back from the target process to `dotnet monitor`. Instead, they are written directly to disk by the runtime. After successful collection of a process dump, `dotnet monitor` will read the process dump directly from disk. In the default configuration, the directory that the runtime writes its process dump to is the temp directory (`%TMP%` on Windows, `/tmp` on \*nix). It is possible to change to the ephemeral directory that these dump files get written to via the following configuration:

>**Note**: This option is optional if `dotnet monitor` is running in the same process namespace as the target processes or if `DefaultSharedPath` is specified.

## Shared Library Path

First Available: 8.0 Preview 7

The shared library path option (`SharedLibraryPath`) allows specifying the path to where shared libraries are copied from the `dotnet monitor` installation to make them available to target applications for in-process diagnostics scenarios, such as call stack collection.

>**Note**: This option is not required if `DefaultSharedPath` is specified. This option provides an alternative directory path compared to the behavior of specifying `DefaultSharedPath`.
