# Collection Rule Configuration

`dotnet monitor` can be configured to automatically collect diagnostic artifacts based on conditions within the discovered processes.

Collection rules are specified in configuration as a named item under the `CollectionRules` property at the root of the configuration. Each collection rule has four properties for describing the behavior of the rule:
- [`Filters`](#filters) - A set of process filters to select which processes the rule should be applied
- [`Trigger`](#triggers) - The metric and it's threshold that will be used to trigger the action
  - [AspNetRequestCount](#aspnetrequestcount-trigger)
  - [AspNetRequestDuration](#aspnetrequestduration-trigger)
  - [AspNetResponseStatus](#aspnetresponsestatus-trigger)
  - [EventCounter](#eventcounter-trigger)
  - [EventMeter](#eventmeter-trigger-80)
  - [Trigger shortcuts](../collectionrules/triggershortcuts.md) 
- [`Actions`](#actions) - The action to be be performed
  - [CollectDump](#collectdump-action)
  - [CollectExceptions](#collectexceptions-action)
  - [CollectGCDump](#collectgcdump-action)
  - [CollectTrace](#collecttrace-action)
  - [CollectLiveMetrics](#collectlivemetrics-action)
  - [CollectLogs](#collectlogs-action)
  - [Execute](#execute-action)
  - [CollectStacks](#collectstacks-action)
  - [LoadProfiler](#loadprofiler-action)
  - [SetEnvironmentVariable](#setenvironmentvariable-action)
  - [GetEnvironmentVariable](#getenvironmentvariable-action)
- [`Limits`](#limits) - Constrains the lifetime of the rule and how often its actions can be run before being throttled

## Example

<
The following is a collection rule that collects a 1 minute CPU trace and egresses it to a provider named "TmpDir" after it has detected high CPU usage for 10 seconds. The rule only applies to processes named "dotnet" and only collects at most 2 traces per 1 hour sliding time window.

## Filters

Each collection rule can specify a set of process filters to select which processes the rule should be applied. The filter criteria are the same as those used for the [default process](./default-process-configuration.md) configuration.

### Example

The following example shows the `Filters` portion of a collection rule that has the rule only apply to processes named `dotnet` and whose command line contains `myapp.dll`.

## Triggers

A trigger will monitor for a specific condition in the target application and raise a notification when that condition has been observed.

### `AspNetRequestCount` Trigger

A trigger that has its condition satisfied when the number of HTTP requests is above the described threshold level for a sliding window of time. The request paths can be filtered according to the described patterns.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default Value | Min Value | Max Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RequestCount` | int | true | The threshold of the number of requests that start within the sliding window of time. | | | |
| `SlidingWindowDuration` | TimeSpan? | false | The sliding time window in which the number of requests are counted. | `"00:01:00"` (one minute) | `"00:00:01"` (one second) | `"1.00:00:00"` (1 day) |
| `IncludePaths` | string[] | false | The list of request path patterns to monitor. If not specified, all request paths are considered. If specified, only request paths matching one of the patterns in this list will be considered. Request paths matching a pattern in the `ExcludePaths` list will be ignored. | `null` | | |
| `ExcludePaths` | string[] | false | The list of request path patterns to ignore. Request paths matching a pattern in this list will be ignored. | `null` | | |

The `IncludePaths` and `ExcludePaths` support [wildcards and globbing](#aspnet-request-path-wildcards-and-globbing).

#### Example

Usage that is satisfied when request count is higher than 500 requests during a 1 minute period for all paths under the `/api` route:

Long running requests (ones that do not send a complete response within the threshold duration) are included in the count. The request paths can be filtered according to the described patterns.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default Value | Min Value | Max Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `RequestCount` | int | true | The threshold of the number of slow requests that start within the sliding window of time. | | | |

### Built-In Default Triggers

These [trigger shortcuts](../collectionrules/triggershortcuts.md) simplify configuration for several common `EventCounter` providers.

### ASP.NET Request Path Wildcards and Globbing

The `IncludePaths` and `ExcludePaths` properties of the ASP.NET triggers allow for wildcards and globbing so that every included or excluded path does not necessarily need to be explicitly specified. For these triggers, a match with an `ExcludePaths` pattern will supersede a match with an `IncludePaths` pattern.

The globstar `**/` will match zero or more path segments including the forward slash `/` character at the end of the segment.

The wildcard `*` will match zero or more non-forward-slash `/` characters.

#### Examples

| Pattern | Matches | Non-Matches |
|---|---|---|
| `**/*` | All paths | No exclusions |
| `/images/**/*` | `/images/logo.png`, `/images/products/1.png` | `/index/header.png` |
| `**/*.js` | `/script.js`, `/path/script.js`, `/path/sub/script.js` | `/script.js/page.html` |
| `**/sub/*.html` | `/path/sub/page.html`, `/sub/page.html` | `/sub/script.js`, `/path/doc.txt` |

## Actions

Actions allow executing an operation or an external executable in response to a trigger condition being satisfied.

### `CollectDump` Action

An action that collects a dump of the process that the collection rule is targeting.

#### Properties

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `Type` | [DumpType](../api/definitions.md#dumptype) | false | The type of dump to collect | `WithHeap` |
| `Egress` | string | true | The named [egress provider](../egress.md) for egressing the collected dump. | |

#### Outputs

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| `EgressPath` | The path of the file that was egressed using the specified egress provider. |

#### Example

Usage that collects a full dump and egresses it to a provider named "AzureBlobDumps".

## Limits

Collection rules have limits that constrain the lifetime of the rule and how often its actions can be run before being throttled.

| Name | Type | Required | Description | Default Value | Min Value | Max Value |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ActionCount` | int | false | The number of times the action list may be executed before being throttled. | 5 | | |
| `ActionCountSlidingWindowDuration` | TimeSpan? | false | The sliding window of time to consider whether the action list should be throttled based on the number of times the action list was executed. Executions that fall outside the window will not count toward the limit specified in the ActionCount setting. If not specified, all action list executions will be counted for the entire duration of the rule. | `null` | `"00:00:01"` (1 second) | `"1.00:00:00"` (1 day) |
| `RuleDuration` | TimeSpan? | false | The amount of time before the rule will stop monitoring a process after it has been applied to a process. If not specified, the rule will monitor the process with the trigger indefinitely. | `null` | `"00:00:01"` (1 second) | `"365.00:00:00"` (1 year) |

### Example

The following example shows the `Limits` portion of a collection rule that has the rule only allow its actions to run 3 times within a 1 hour sliding time window.

<details>
  <summary>JSON</summary>

  ```json
  {
      "Limits": {
          "ActionCount": 3,
          "ActionCountSlidingWindowDuration": "01:00:00"
      }
  }
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Kubernetes ConfigMap</summary>
  
  ```yaml
  CollectionRules__RuleName__Limits__ActionCount: "3"
  CollectionRules__RuleName__Limits__ActionCountSlidingWindowDuration: "01:00:00"
  ```
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Kubernetes Environment Variables</summary>
  
  ```yaml
  - name: DotnetMonitor_CollectionRules__RuleName__Limits__ActionCount
    value: "3"
  - name: DotnetMonitor_CollectionRules__RuleName__Limits__ActionCountSlidingWindowDuration
    value: "01:00:00"
  ```
</details>

## Collection Rule Defaults

Collection rule defaults are specified in configuration as a named item under the `CollectionRuleDefaults` property at the root of the configuration. Defaults can be used to limit the verbosity of configuration, allowing frequently used values for collection rules to be assigned as defaults. The following are the currently supported collection rule defaults:

| Name | Section | Type | Applies To |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Egress` | `Actions` | string | [CollectDump](#collectdump-action), [CollectGCDump](#collectgcdump-action), [CollectTrace](#collecttrace-action), [CollectLiveMetrics](#collectlivemetrics-action), [CollectLogs](#collectlogs-action) |
| `SlidingWindowDuration` | `Triggers` | TimeSpan? | [AspNetRequestCount](#aspnetrequestcount-trigger), [AspNetRequestDuration](#aspnetrequestduration-trigger), [AspNetResponseStatus](#aspnetresponsestatus-trigger), [EventCounter](#eventcounter-trigger) |
| `RequestCount` | `Triggers` | int | [AspNetRequestCount](#aspnetrequestcount-trigger), [AspNetRequestDuration](#aspnetrequestduration-trigger) |
| `ResponseCount` | `Triggers` | int | [AspNetResponseStatus](#aspnetresponsestatus-trigger) |
| `ActionCount` | `Limits` | int | [Limits](#limits) |
| `ActionCountSlidingWindowDuration` | `Limits` | TimeSpan? | [Limits](#limits) |
| `RuleDuration` | `Limits` | TimeSpan? | [Limits](#limits) |

### Example

The following example includes a default egress provider that corresponds to the `FileSystem` egress provider named `artifacts`. The first action, `CollectDump`, is able to omit the `Settings` section by using the default egress provider. The second action, `CollectGCDump`, is using an egress provider other than the default, and specifies that it will egress to an `AzureBlobStorage` provider named `monitorBlob`.
