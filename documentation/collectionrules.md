# Collection Rules

`dotnet monitor` can be [configured](./configuration.md#Collection-Rule-Configuration) to automatically collect diagnostic artifacts based on conditions within the discovered processes.

>**NOTE:** Collection rules are only enabled when running dotnet-monitor in `Listen` mode. See [Connection Mode](configuration.md#Connection-Mode) configuration for details.
