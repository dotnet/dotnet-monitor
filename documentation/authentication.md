# Authentication

Authenticated requests to `dotnet monitor` help protect sensitive diagnostic artifacts from unauthorized users and lower privileged processes. `dotnet monitor` can be configured to use any one of the following authentication modes:
- [API Key](#api-key-authentication)
- [Azure Active Directory Authentication](#azure-active-directory-authentication)
- [Windows Authentication](#windows-authentication)

It is also possible, although strongly not recommended, to [disable authentication](#disabling-authentication).

> **Note**: Authentication is not performed on requests to the metrics endpoint (by default, http://localhost:52325).

The recommended configuration for `dotnet monitor` is to use [Azure Active Directory Authentication](#azure-active-directory-authentication) over a channel secured with TLS.

## Azure Active Directory Authentication

First Available: 7.1

Azure Active Directory integration (referred to as Azure AD) is the recommended authentication mechanism for `dotnet monitor` as it does not require storing any secrets or rotating keys yourself. To enable Azure AD authentication:

- [Create an App Registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#register-an-application) in your Azure tenant that will be used by `dotnet monitor`. Note that a single App Registration can be used by multiple instances of `dotnet monitor`.
- [Add a new app role](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps#app-roles-ui) for general API access.
- [Assign user to role](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-apps#assign-users-and-groups-to-roles) via the Enterprise Applications section of AAD.
- [Configure Azure AD in dotnet monitor](./configuration/azure-ad-authentication-configuration.md).

> **Note**: Azure AD B2C is currently not supported.

### Authenticating with a Managed Identity

`dotnet monitor` supports other applications calling its APIs using a [Managed Identity](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/) when Azure AD is configured. You will need to have added an app role to `dotnet monitor`'s App Registration as described above and then assign it to the Managed Identity using either the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-assign-app-role-managed-identity-cli) or [PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-to-assign-app-role-managed-identity-powershell).

### Authenticating with the Azure CLI

If a user is a member of the necessary app role, they can obtain a valid auth token using the Azure CLI:

```sh
az account get-access-token --resource <Application ID URI> --query accessToken --output tsv
```

You can then use that token like so:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <Token from Azure CLI>" https://localhost:52323/processes
```

- If using PowerShell, you can use `Invoke-WebRequest` but it does not accept the same parameters.

```powershell
 (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://localhost:52323/processes -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Bearer <Token from Azure CLI>' }).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
```

### Interactively authenticating using the Swagger UI

If you want Azure AD users to be able to interactively authenticate with your `dotnet monitor` instance using the in-box Swagger UI you will need to:
- [Add a new scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-configure-app-expose-web-apis#add-a-scope). This scope will only be used to enable interactive authentication and users will still be required to be part of the configured app role. Custom Application ID URIs are supported.
- [Add a redirect URI to the App Registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app#add-a-redirect-uri).
  1. Select `Single-page application` as the platform.
  1. For the redirect URI, enter `{dotnet monitor address}/swagger/oauth2-redirect.html`, where `{dotnet monitor address}` is the address of your `dotnet monitor` instance.
  > **Note**: If using `localhost` for the address, you do **not** need to specify the port number. Example: `https://localhost/swagger/oauth2-redirect.html`

## Windows Authentication

We only recommend using Windows Authentication if you're running `dotnet monitor` as a local development tool on Windows; for all other environments using an [API Key](#api-key-authentication) is recommended.

Windows authentication doesn't require explicit configuration and is enabled automatically when running `dotnet monitor` on Windows. When available, `dotnet monitor` will authorize any user authenticated as the same user that started the `dotnet monitor` process. It is not possible to disable Windows authentication.

> **Note**: Windows authentication will not be attempted if you are running `dotnet monitor` as an Administrator

## API Key Authentication

API Keys are referred to as `MonitorApiKey` in configuration and source code but we will shorten the term to "API key" in this document. To enable API key authentication:

- You will need to generate a secret token, update the configuration of `dotnet monitor`, and then specify the secret token in the `Authorization` header on all requests to `dotnet monitor`. To configure API Key authentication using the integrated `generatekey` command see: [API Key Setup](./api-key-setup.md).

  or

- Use the `--temp-apikey` command line option to generate a one-time API key for that instantiation of dotnet-monitor. The API key will be reported back as part of log output during the startup of the process.

> **Note**: API Key Authentication should only be used when TLS is enabled to protect the key while in transit. `dotnet monitor` will emit a warning if authentication is enabled over an insecure transport medium.

## Authenticating requests

### Windows authentication

> **Note**: Windows authentication is only supported when also using API Key authentication and not running elevated.

- When using a web browser, it will automatically handle the Windows authentication challenge.

- To use Windows authentication with PowerShell, you can specify the `-UseDefaultCredentials` flag for `Invoke-WebRequest` or `--negotiate` for `curl.exe`
```powershell
curl.exe --negotiate https://localhost:52323/processes -u $(whoami)
```
```powershell
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://localhost:52323/processes -UseDefaultCredentials).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
```

### API Authentication

- If you are using an API Key, you must specify it via the `Authorization` header.

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API Key from GenerateKey command>" https://localhost:52323/processes
```

- If using PowerShell, you can use `Invoke-WebRequest` but it does not accept the same parameters.

```powershell
 (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://localhost:52323/processes -Headers @{ 'Authorization' = 'Bearer <API Key from GenerateKey command>' }).Content | ConvertFrom-Json
```



## Disabling Authentication

Disabling authentication could enable lower privileged processes to exfiltrate sensitive information, such as the full contents of memory, from any .NET application running within the same boundary. You should only disable authentication when you have evaluated and mitigated the security implications of running `dotnet monitor` unauthenticated.

Authentication can be turned off by specifying the `--no-auth` option to `dotnet monitor` at startup:
```powershell
dotnet monitor collect --no-auth
```
