# Sample Pull Request

To contribute to the `dotnet monitor` repo, you'll need to create a [pull request](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/pulls). When you submit a pull request, you'll receive feedback on your changes from the `dotnet monitor` team. Before your code can be merged, you'll need the following:
 * At least one approval from a `dotnet monitor` team member
 * All conversations/feedback must be resolved
 * All builds/tests must be passing

Once the above conditions have been met, a member of the `dotnet-monitor` team will merge your changes into the product. To get a better idea of what pull requests look like, check out an [example.](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/pull/2919)
