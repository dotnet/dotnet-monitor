# Egress Extensibility

As of version 7.0, `dotnet monitor` adds support for egress extensibility, allowing users to provide their own egress provider in addition to using the existing egress options.

## Creating an Egress Extension

### Overview

If you'd like to contribute your own egress extension, please review our guidelines (**insert link here**) before submitting a pull request at **insert link here**. 

#### Guidelines (Might be hosted on the other GitHub - putting here for now)

By default, egress extensions are considered unverified/experimental (need to settle on official terminology). The basic requirements for an unverified extension include:

- Verify that your extension works correctly and abides by the egress extension contract (**insert link here**)
- Does not include personal credentials to connect to an egress provider
- 



Main branch -> goes to nuget, approved/verified
Other branches -> Where everything goes initially, still has to go through preliminary review but has less stringent requirements
