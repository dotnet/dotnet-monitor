Today we are releasing the official 7.0.0 Release Candidate of the `dotnet monitor` tool. This release includes:

- Add the option to specify a `StoppingEvent` on the `CollectTrace` action. The trace will be stopped once either the duration is reached or the specified event occurs. ([#2557](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/pull/2557))
