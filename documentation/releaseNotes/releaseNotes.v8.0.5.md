Today we are releasing the 8.0.5 build of the `dotnet monitor` tool. This release includes:

- Fixed an issue that could sometimes result in exceptions having incomplete stack information reported in exception history. ([#7395](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/pull/7395))
- Fixed an issue that could sometimes result in exceptions not being reported in exception history. ([#7302](https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor/pull/7302))
