Today we are releasing the next official preview of the `dotnet monitor` tool. This release includes:

- ðŸ”¬ Add collect stacks api and action (#2512, #2525)
- Avoid Kestrel address override warning (#2535)
- Only create default diagnostic port when running in listen mode (#2523)
- Fixed an issue (#2526) where the `config` command could throw an exception (#2530)
