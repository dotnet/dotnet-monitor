# Collection Rules - List

First Available: 6.3

Get the basic state of all collection rules for all processes or for the specified process.

## HTTP Route

```http
GET /collectionrules?pid={pid}&uid={uid}&name={name} HTTP/1.1
```

> **Note**: Process information (IDs, names, environment, etc) may change between invocations of these APIs. Processes may start or stop between API invocations, causing this information to change.

## Host Address

The default host address for these routes is `https://localhost:52323`. This route is only available on the addresses configured via the `--urls` command line parameter and the `DOTNETMONITOR_URLS` environment variable.

## URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pid` | query | false | int | The ID of the process. |
| `uid` | query | false | guid | A value that uniquely identifies a runtime instance within a process. |
| `name` | query | false | string | The name of the process. |

See [ProcessIdentifier](definitions.md#processidentifier) for more details about the `pid`, `uid`, and `name` parameters.

If none of `pid`, `uid`, or `name` are specified, the state of collection rules for the [default process](defaultprocess.md) will be provided. Attempting to get the state of collection rules from the default process when the default process cannot be resolved will fail.

## Authentication

Authentication is enforced for this route. See [Authentication](./../authentication.md) for further information.

Allowed schemes:
- `Bearer`
- `Negotiate` (Windows only, running as unelevated)
