# Logs - Get

Captures log statements that are logged to the [ILogger<> infrastructure](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging) within a specified process. By default, logs are collected at the levels as specified by the [application-defined configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#configure-logging).

> **NOTE:** The [`LoggingEventSource`](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging#event-source) provider must be enabled in the process in order to capture logs.

## HTTP Route

```http
GET /logs?pid={pid}&uid={uid}&name={name}&level={level}&durationSeconds={durationSeconds}&egressProvider={egressProvider} HTTP/1.1
```

> **NOTE:** Process information (IDs, names, environment, etc) may change between invocations of these APIs. Processes may start or stop between API invocations, causing this information to change.

## Host Address

The default host address for these routes is `https://localhost:52323`. This route is only available on the addresses configured via the `--urls` command line parameter and the `DOTNETMONITOR_URLS` environment variable.

## URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pid` | query | false | int | The ID of the process. |
| `uid` | query | false | guid | A value that uniquely identifies a runtime instance within a process. |
| `name` | query | false | string | The name of the process. |
| `level` | query | false | [LogLevel](definitions.md#loglevel) | The name of the log level at which log events are collected. If not specified, logs are collected levels as specified by the [application-defined configuration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/logging/#configure-logging). |
| `durationSeconds` | query | false | int | The duration of the log collection operation in seconds. Default is `30`. Min is `-1` (indefinite duration). Max is `2147483647`. |
| `egressProvider` | query | false | string | If specified, uses the named egress provider for egressing the collected logs. When not specified, the logs are written to the HTTP response stream. See [Egress Providers](../egress.md) for more details. |

See [ProcessIdentifier](definitions.md#processidentifier) for more details about the `pid`, `uid`, and `name` parameters.

If none of `pid`, `uid`, or `name` are specified, logs for the [default process](defaultprocess.md) will be captured. Attempting to capture logs of the default process when the default process cannot be resolved will fail.

## Authentication

Authentication is enforced for this route. See [Authentication](./../authentication.md) for further information.

Allowed schemes:
- `Bearer`
- `Negotiate` (Windows only, running as unelevated)

## Responses

| Name | Type | Description | Content Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 OK | | The logs from the process formatted as [newline delimited JSON](https://github.com/ndjson/ndjson-spec). Each JSON object is a [LogEntry](definitions.md#logentry) | `application/x-ndjson` |
| 200 OK | | The logs from the process formatted as plain text, similar to the output of the JSON console formatter. | `text/plain` |
| 202 Accepted | | When an egress provider is specified, the Location header containers the URI of the operation for querying the egress status. | |
| 400 Bad Request | [ValidationProblemDetails](definitions.md#validationproblemdetails) | An error occurred due to invalid input. The response body describes the specific problem(s). | `application/problem+json` |
| 401 Unauthorized | | Authentication is required to complete the request. See [Authentication](./../authentication.md) for further information. | |
| 429 Too Many Requests | | There are too many logs requests at this time. Try to request logs at a later time. | `application/problem+json` |
