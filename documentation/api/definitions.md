# Definitions

## ProcessIdentifier

Object with process identifying information. The properties on this object describe indentifying aspects for a found process; these values can be used in other API calls to perform operations on specific processes.

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pid` | int | The ID of the process. |
| `uid` | guid | `.NET 5+` A value that uniquely identifies a runtime instance within a process.<br/>`.NET Core 3.1` An empty value: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` |

The `uid` property is useful for uniquely identifying a process when it is running in an environment where the process ID may not be unique (e.g. multiple containers within a Kubernetes pod will have entrypoint processes with process ID 1).

### Example

```json
{
    "pid": 21632,
    "uid": "cd4da319-fa9e-4987-ac4e-e57b2aac248b"
}
```

## ProcessInfo

Object with detailed information about a specific process.

Some properties will have non-null values for procesess that are running on .NET 5 or newer (denoted with `.NET 5+`). These properties will be null for runtime versions prior to .NET 5.

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `pid` | int | The ID of the process. |
| `uid` | guid | `.NET 5+` A value that uniquely identifies a runtime instance within a process.<br/>`.NET Core 3.1` An empty value: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` |
| `name` | string | The name of the process. |
| `commandLine` | string | The command line of the process (includes process path and arguments) |
| `operatingSystem` | string | `.NET 5+` The operating system on which the process is running (e.g. `windows`, `linux`, `macos`).<br/>`.NET Core 3.1` A value of `null`. |
| `processArchitecture` | string | `.NET 5+` The architecture of the process (e.g. `x64`, `x86`).<br/>`.NET Core 3.1` A value of `null`. |

The `uid` property is useful for uniquely identifying a process when it is running in an environment where the process ID may not be unique (e.g. multiple containers within a Kubernetes pod will have entrypoint processes with process ID 1).

### Example

```json
{
    "pid": 21632,
    "uid": "cd4da319-fa9e-4987-ac4e-e57b2aac248b",
    "name": "dotnet",
    "commandLine": "\"C:\\Program Files\\dotnet\\dotnet.exe\" ConsoleApp1.dll",
    "operatingSystem": "Windows",
    "processArchitecture": "x64"
}
```

## ValidationProblemDetails

Object for specifying errors and validation results based on https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807

| Name | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `detail` | string | An explanation specific to this occurrence of the problem. |
| `errors` | map | (Optional) The validation errors related to the request. |
| `extensions` | map | (Optional) Extension members containing additional information about the problem. |
| `instance` | string | (Optional) A URI reference that identifies the specific occurrence of the problem. |
| `status` | int | The HTTP status code generated by the origin server for this occurrence of the problem. |
| `title` | string | (Optional) A short summary of the problem type. |
| `type` | string | (Optional) A URI reference that identifies the problem type. |

### Example

```json
{
    "title": "One or more validation errors occurred.",
    "status": 400,
    "errors": {
        "Providers": [
            "The Providers field is required."
        ]
    }
}
