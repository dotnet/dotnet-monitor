# Trace - Get Custom

Captures a diagnostic trace of a process using the given set of event providers specified in the request body.

## HTTP Route

```http
POST /trace?pid={pid}&uid={uid}&name={name}&durationSeconds={durationSeconds}&egressProvider={egressProvider} HTTP/1.1
```

> **NOTE:** Process information (IDs, names, environment, etc) may change between invocations of these APIs. Processes may start or stop between API invocations, causing this information to change.

## Host Address

The default host address for these routes is `https://localhost:52323`. This route is only available on the addresses configured via the `--urls` command line parameter and the `DOTNETMONITOR_URLS` environment variable.

## URI Parameters

| Name | In | Required | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `pid` | query | false | int | The ID of the process. |
| `uid` | query | false | guid | A value that uniquely identifies a runtime instance within a process. |
| `name` | query | false | string | The name of the process. |
| `durationSeconds` | query | false | int | The duration of the trace operation in seconds. Default is `30`. Min is `-1` (indefinite duration). Max is `2147483647`. |
| `egressProvider` | query | false | string | If specified, uses the named egress provider for egressing the collected trace. When not specified, the trace is written to the HTTP response stream. See [Egress Providers](../egress.md) for more details. |

See [ProcessIdentifier](definitions.md#processidentifier) for more details about the `pid`, `uid`, and `name` parameters.

If none of `pid`, `uid`, or `name` are specified, a trace of the [default process](defaultprocess.md) will be captured. Attempting to capture a trace of the default process when the default process cannot be resolved will fail.

## Authentication

Authentication is enforced for this route. See [Authentication](./../authentication.md) for further information.

Allowed schemes:
- `Bearer`
- `Negotiate` (Windows only, running as unelevated)

## Request Body

A request body of type [EventProvidersConfiguration](definitions.md#eventprovidersconfiguration) is required.

The expected content type is `application/json`.

## Responses

| Name | Type | Description | Content Type |
|---|---|---|---|
| 200 OK | stream | A trace of the process. | `application/octet-stream` |
| 202 Accepted | | When an egress provider is specified, the Location header containers the URI of the operation for querying the egress status. | |
| 400 Bad Request | [ValidationProblemDetails](definitions.md#validationproblemdetails) | An error occurred due to invalid input. The response body describes the specific problem(s). | `application/problem+json` |
| 401 Unauthorized | | Authentication is required to complete the request. See [Authentication](./../authentication.md) for further information. | |
| 429 Too Many Requests | | There are too many trace requests at this time. Try to request a trace at a later time. | `application/problem+json` |

> **NOTE:** After the expiration of the trace duration, completing the request may take a long time (up to several minutes) for large applications if `EventProvidersConfiguration.RequestRundown` is set to `true`. The runtime needs to send over the type cache for all managed code that was captured in the trace, known as rundown events. Thus, the length of time of the request may take significantly longer than the requested duration.

## Examples

### Sample Request

```http
POST /trace?pid=21632&durationSeconds=60 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:52323
Authorization: Bearer fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff=
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "Providers": [{
        "Name": "Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler",
        "EventLevel": "Informational"
    },{
        "Name": "Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime",
        "EventLevel": "Informational",
        "Keywords": "0x14C14FCCBD"
    }],
    "BufferSizeInMB": 1024
}
```

or

```http
POST /trace?uid=cd4da319-fa9e-4987-ac4e-e57b2aac248b&durationSeconds=60 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:52323
Authorization: Bearer fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff=
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "Providers": [{
        "Name": "Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler",
        "EventLevel": "Informational"
    },{
        "Name": "Microsoft-Windows-DotNETRuntime",
        "EventLevel": "Informational",
        "Keywords": "0x14C14FCCBD"
    }],
    "BufferSizeInMB": 1024
}
```

### Sample Response

The 1 minute trace with CPU information, chunk encoded, is returned as the response body.

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
```

## Supported Runtimes

| Operating System | Runtime Version |

| Linux | .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5+ |
| MacOS | .NET Core 3.1, .NET 5+ |

## Additional Notes

### When to use `pid` vs `uid`

See [Process ID `pid` vs Unique ID `uid`](pidvsuid.md) for clarification on when it is best to use either parameter.

### View the collected `.nettrace` file

On Windows, `.nettrace` files can be viewed in [PerfView](https://github.com/microsoft/perfview) for analysis or in Visual Studio. 

A `.nettrace` files can be converted to another format (e.g. SpeedScope or Chromium) using the [dotnet-trace](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/diagnostics/dotnet-trace) tool.

### Indefinite traces are inaccessible

When setting `durationSeconds` to `-1` (indefinite duration), there is currently no way to terminate the trace operation that preserves the `.nettrace` file in an accessible format. This also applies when prematurely terminating a trace operation that uses a finite value for `durationSeconds`.
