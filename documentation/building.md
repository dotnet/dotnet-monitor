# Clone, build and test the repo
------------------------------

To clone, build and test the repo on Windows:

```cmd
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor
cd dotnet-monitor
.\Build.cmd
.\Test.cmd
```


On Linux and macOS:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-monitor
cd dotnet-monitor
./build.sh
./test.sh
```

If you prefer to use *Visual Studio*, *Visual Studio Code*, or *Visual Studio for Mac*, you can open the `dotnet monitor` solution at the root of the repo.

Another test change...
