      Keep MicrosoftDiagnosticsMonitoringShippedVersion in-sync with the latest publicly shipped version of Microsoft.Diagnostics.DbgShim:
      - In release branches we want to only use versions of Microsoft.Diagnostics.Monitoring.* packages that
        were built together with other packages from dotnet/diagnostics that have publicly shipped on nuget.org.
      - Microsoft.Diagnostics.Monitoring.* packages are not shipped via nuget.org, and instead are available via
        the dotnet-tools feed, but it contains additional (often newer) versions that don't correspond to
        the publicly shipped related packages.
      - Microsoft.Diagnostics.DbgShim, and select other packages from dotnet/diagnostics, share the same version tag as the
        Microsoft.Diagnostics.Monitoring.* packages so we can use them to manage MicrosoftDiagnosticsMonitoring*LibraryVersion.
      - This project is evaluated by dependabot using msbuild, so we have to use a package that can actually be restored,
        so use Microsoft.Diagnostics.DbgShim.
